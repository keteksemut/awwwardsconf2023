They seek to challenge conservative frameworks and they do it with their backs straight, supported by their unbreakable values. They don't cower away from the challenge, as they see that the magic lies within the unexplored. In order to be great - you have to be brave and bold. In order to be real -  you have to stand up for your opinions and beliefs. And that is Snask - brave, bold and real. They excel at branding, design and film and refuse to do anything else than what they see as world class. They are doctors of disturbance, wizards of disruption and spokesmen of disobedience. They take on the responsibility to stay engaged, give a damn, and strive for empathy. There is a short word for this assumption of responsibility: Snask.",

The range of its presence is in the technical details of design, to the ways to think and approach design, and to what the 'ideal' career path is. Throughout the talk, I plan to go through some examples of previous work to exemplify some of these points, observations of its dynamic at play in our broader industry\u002Fparallels to everyday life, and use personal experience to exemplify the risk\u002Freward of embracing it.",

The future is rooted, it not an abstract concept that is detached from our realities, rather it is rooted in our experience of time and the systems around us. But most importantly, the future is political. It is political in the sense that it affects every one of us, in various aspects of our lives. As designers, we have the knowledge and skills of translating the public's voice into insights, and their hopes and dreams into realities. This is why to design for good, we need to think about the future, and in this process we learn how to build optimism for the future. Optimism is a skill, it can be increased by learning, playing, and designing for the future. It is through these actions that we increase our future literacy, and it helps us to democratize the future, making the future a playground for all. ",
